Face Recognition

Face Recognition - Deep Learning Based Facial Analysis Suite
A lightweight yet powerful Python library for face detection, facial landmarking, and identity recognition.
Built and maintained by Chrissie Raj. Powered by dlib and deep learning models with 99.38% accuracy on the LFW benchmark.

Key Features
•	Face Detection — Locate all faces in an image
•	Facial Landmark Extraction — Detect eyes, nose, mouth, and jawline
•	Identity Matching — Compare known vs unknown faces
•	Command-Line Tools — Run face recognition directly from terminal
•	GPU-accelerated Option — Faster recognition with CNN models

Quick Start
import face_recognition

# Load and detect faces
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)

# Facial landmarks
landmarks = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)

# Face recognition
known_img = face_recognition.load_image_file("known.jpg")
unknown_img = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")

known_enc = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_img)[0]
unknown_enc = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_img)[0]

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([known_enc], unknown_enc)
